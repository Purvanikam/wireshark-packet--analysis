# Wireshark Packet Analysis

This project documents a live network traffic capture and analysis using Wireshark.  
The objective was to capture packets, identify basic protocols, and analyze their characteristics.

## Contents
- `capture_guide.md` — step-by-step instructions for capturing traffic.
- `REPORT.md` — detailed findings and protocol analysis.
- `filters.txt` — useful Wireshark filter commands.
- `export_instructions.md` — how to export captures and reports.
- `screenshots/` — capture window and protocol hierarchy visuals.
- `capture_session.pcap` — saved capture session.
- `.gitignore` — ignored files for the repo.
- `LICENSE` — project license.

## Tools Used
- Wireshark v4.x
- Windows 10 Pro (64-bit)
- Google Chrome

## Summary
The captured data includes protocols such as:
- DNS (Domain Name System)
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)

The analysis helped understand packet structure, communication flow, and filtering techniques.
